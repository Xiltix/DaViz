# Changelog

## v2.0.0-rc.0

Date: 23 Feb 2020

This pre-release perform an entire refactoring in the simulation and glue module to prepare the application for a native Java implementation of the simulation.

The Frege simulation can still be used but the Java simulation module is however, not initiated yet.

### Features

- [#11](https://github.com/praalhans/DaViz/issues/11) - Prepare application to receive a java port

### Development process changes

- [#12](https://github.com/praalhans/DaViz/issues/12) - Replace Eclipse for Intellij IDEA 

## v1.0.1

Date 8 Jan 2020

This release provides minor fixes and improvements, ensuring that the Tree and Echo algorithm can be simulated.

### Fix

- [#1](https://github.com/praalhans/DaViz/issues/1) - Attempt to fix class path libraries for any contributor 
- [#2](https://github.com/praalhans/DaViz/issues/2) - Cannot make simulations using the tree algorithm 
- [#9](https://github.com/praalhans/DaViz/issues/9) - Enable Echo algorithm 

### Docummentation

- [5](https://github.com/praalhans/DaViz/issues/5) - Describe Frege implementation of Tarry and Tree algorithms

## v1.0.0

Date: 9 Dec 2019

This release sets the beginning of versioning control and provides a functional prototype of DaViz and allows users to visualize and simulate the following wave algorithms:

Awerbuch
